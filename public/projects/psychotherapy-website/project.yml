  I built my first website using wordpress for my small psychotherapy practice. It is a single page and using the basic wordpress template but it does the job.
  This version is the third iteration of the website. I learned to setup a wordpress website and to host it on Amazon Lightsail. I'm interested in learning more about wordpress.
